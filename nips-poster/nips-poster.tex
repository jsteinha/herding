\begin{theorem}
Consider the primal (respectively the dual) algorithm. Suppose that $h$ ($R$) is strongly convex with respect to a norm $\|\cdot\|$ 
and let $r = \sup_{\theta} \|\theta\|_{*}$ ($r = \sup_{u} \|u\|_{*}$). Then
\[ \sup_{\theta} L(\hat{u}, \theta) \leq \sup_{\theta} L(u^*, \theta) + \frac{2r^2}{A_T} \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{\alpha_{t+1}^2A_t}{A_{t+1}^2}. \]
\end{theorem}
\end{column}
\begin{column}{0.45\linewidth}
\begin{corollary} 
Under the hypotheses of the Theorem, for $\alpha_{t} = 1$ we have
\[ \sup_{\theta} L(\hat{u}, \theta) \leq \sup_{\theta} L(u^*, \theta) + \frac{2r^2 (\log (T) + 1)}{T}. \]
and for $\alpha_t = t$ we have
\[ \sup_{\theta} L(\hat{u}, \theta) \leq \sup_{\theta} L(u^*, \theta) + \frac{8r^2}{T}. \]
